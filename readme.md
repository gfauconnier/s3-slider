#Semaine 3 : Slider

##Presentation :  
We had to do a slider using js/DOM.

##What's inside :  
__index.html__ : I used only 1 figure containing an img and a figcaption + 2 buttons to navigate  
through the images.  
__main.css__ : a few declarations, nothing fancy.  
__main.js__ : contains the only function making the slide automatic + buttons work.  

##How ?  
JS + DOM
